This project was for my techincal assessment for an offer, this is my first time touching Laravel framework, tho I'm familiar with MVC working frame, all of the command prompts and syntax's and ways are all new to me. I actually learned alot with this project, mainly how I hated blade haha, I figured out too late that you could integrate Vue or React with Laravel, so Laravel would act as the Backend framework and these guys would be its frontend. If I knew it early on I could've done this way faster that 2-3 days it was assigned to me, and I could've make it more complex than it is. For example the drag and move functions still needs the page to be refreshed in order to see the changes, while Blade's pages are fast in reloading the pages, it would have been much nicer if these processes can be done async without the needs to refresh the pages. Like in React I could use the memo or useEffects to great length to make sure its done behind and feels instantanious, or the watch or watch/compute/watchEffect for Vue. In any case I've learnt alot and while I kind of hate it at first, I figured with Laravel everything is set up nicely and I don't have to gruesomely build the structure of my backend with React like what I did with my postgreSQL project. All of the Models, Policy and Controller along with the database is done by Laravel, I just change some of the functions and rules and bam, all I need to focus was how to get the variables into the front end and processes in the backend and I'm done. Quick and easy.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
